<h3>Assignment 7 <small>due 2:30pm April 3</small></h3>

<p>In this assignment, you'll be playing with Spark Streaming. Unlike
the previous assignments that involve a substantial amount of
implementation, the goal of this assignment is to give you some
exposure to Spark Streaming without getting into too much detail. In
other words, this assignment is easier and less time-consuming that
previous assignments, by design.</p>

<p>We'll be working with a dataset released by the New York City Taxi
&amp; Limousine Commission that captures over one billion individual
taxi trips over the past several years. This assignment is inspired by
Todd Schneider's very nice blog post
titled <a href="http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/">Analyzing
1.1 Billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips, with a Vengeance</a> (worth a
read!). You can find the raw
data <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml">here</a>.
The dataset is historic, but we're going to treat it as a data stream
and perform simple analyses using Spark Streaming.</p>

<p>Since the dataset is 100s of GB and too large for an assignment,
we're going to work with a small one-day slice, but that should be
sufficient to give you a flavor of what Spark Streaming is like. The
slice of the dataset is stored in
the <a href="https://github.com/lintool/bespin-data"><code>bespin-data</code></a>
repo. Go ahead and grab the data.</p>

<p>For this assignment, since the dataset is small, everything can be
done in the Linux Student CS environment. That is, there is no
Altiscale component for this assignment. We'll be marking your
assignment in the Linux Student CS environment, and you can assume
that we will supply the correct path to this dataset.</p>

<p>Here's what the dataset looks like:</p>

<pre>
$ head -1 taxi-data/part-2015-12-01-0001.csv 
green,2,2015-12-01 00:01:03,2015-12-01 00:01:29,N,1,-73.937652587890625,40.804546356201172,-73.940483093261719,40.805999755859375,1,.06,2.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,,0.3,3.8,2,1
</pre>

<p>The schema is as follows:</p>

<pre>
type,VendorID,tpep_pickup_datetime,tpep_dropoff_datetime,passenger_count,trip_distance,pickup_longitude,pickup_latitude,RatecodeID,store_and_fwd_flag,dropoff_longitude,dropoff_latitude,payment_type,fare_amount,extra,mta_tax,tip_amount,tolls_amount,improvement_surcharge,total_amount
</pre>

<p>Each part file contains one minute worth of trips, so for the
entire day there are 1440 part files. Each one of these becomes a part
of a discretized stream to Spark streaming.</p>

<p>Let's start with a very simple query that aggregates the number of
trips by hour. We've implemented this for you in Bespin
in <a href="https://github.com/lintool/bespin/blob/master/src/main/scala/io/bespin/scala/spark/streaming/EventCount.scala"><code>EventCount</code></a>.
Here's how you run it:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class io.bespin.scala.spark.streaming.EventCount \
 target/bespin-1.0.4-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar --input taxi-data --checkpoint checkpoint --output output
</pre>

<p>The Spark Streaming query itself is simple:</p>

<pre>
    val wc = stream.map(_.split(","))
      .map(tuple => ("all", 1))
      .reduceByKeyAndWindow(
        (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y, (x: Int, y: Int) => x - y, Minutes(60), Minutes(60))
      .persist()
</pre>

<p>Your first task is to understand exactly what's going on the above
snippet of code: consult
the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/streaming/">Spark Streaming
documentation</a>, or alternatively, there are plenty of resources
online &mdash; a simple search will turn up lots of articles and
guides.</p>

<p>Beyond the query itself, the implementation goes through a bunch of
contortions to be able to mock a stream using data from files. There
are a whole host of details, including how to mock a clock so we can
simulate the passage of time. The implementation is based
on <a href="http://blog.ippon.tech/testing-strategy-for-spark-streaming/">this
blog post</a> if you are interested in the details.</p>

<p>The output of each aggregation window is stored in a directory
named <code>output-XXXXX</code> where <code>XXXXX</code> is the
timestamp. The following command will gather all the results
together:</p>

<pre>
$ find output-* -name "part*" | xargs grep 'all' | sed -E 's/^output-([0-9]+)\/part-[0-9]+/\1/' | sort -n
3600000:(all,7396)
7200000:(all,5780)
10800000:(all,3605)
14400000:(all,2426)
18000000:(all,2505)
21600000:(all,3858)
25200000:(all,10258)
28800000:(all,19007)
32400000:(all,23799)
36000000:(all,24003)
39600000:(all,21179)
43200000:(all,20219)
46800000:(all,20522)
50400000:(all,20556)
54000000:(all,21712)
57600000:(all,22016)
61200000:(all,18034)
64800000:(all,19719)
68400000:(all,25563)
72000000:(all,28178)
75600000:(all,27449)
79200000:(all,27072)
82800000:(all,24078)
86400000:(all,18806)
</pre>

<p>There are 24 aggregation windows above, one for each hour.</p>

<p><b>Problem 1</b>: Copy <code>EventCount</code> from Bespin into
your assignment repo under the
package <code>ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a7</code>. We should now be able to
run the following and obtain exactly the same results as above:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a7.EventCount \
 target/assignments-1.0.jar --input taxi-data --checkpoint checkpoint --output output
</pre>

<p>In your <code>pom.xml</code>, you'll need to bump up the version of
Bespin to pull in the Spark Streaming dependencies:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;io.bespin&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;bespin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>Problem 2</b>: Create a query
called <code>RegionEventCount</code> that counts the number of taxi
trips each hour that drop off at either the Goldman Sachs headquarters
or the Citigroup headquarters. See the 
<a href="http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/">Todd
Schneider blog post</a> for context: you're replicating one a
simplified version of one of his analyses. Use these coordinates for
the bounding box of interest:</p>

<pre>
goldman = [[-74.0141012, 40.7152191], [-74.013777, 40.7152275], [-74.0141027, 40.7138745], [-74.0144185, 40.7140753]]
citigroup = [[-74.011869, 40.7217236], [-74.009867, 40.721493], [-74.010140,40.720053], [-74.012083, 40.720267]]
</pre>

<p>To be more precise, you are filtering for taxi trips whose drop off
locations are located within this bounding box and aggregating by
hour. This means that we should be able to run the following job:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a7.RegionEventCount \
 target/assignments-1.0.jar --input taxi-data --checkpoint checkpoint --output output
</pre>

<p>And the following command should gather the answers:</p>

<pre>
$ find output-* -name "part*" | xargs grep 'goldman' | sed -E 's/^output-([0-9]+)\/part-[0-9]+/\1/' | sort -n
21600000:(goldman,?)
25200000:(goldman,?)
28800000:(goldman,?)
...

$ find output-* -name "part*" | xargs grep 'citigroup' | sed -E 's/^output-([0-9]+)\/part-[0-9]+/\1/' | sort -n
3600000:(citigroup,?)
7200000:(citigroup,?)
10800000:(citigroup,?)
...
</pre>

<p>Use exactly "goldman" and "citigroup" for the names of the
keys. The actual counts should appear in place of the "?" above.</p>

<p>As a hint, <code>RegionEventCount</code> requires minimal
modifications over <code>EventCount</code>; basically, add a filter,
and that's it.</p>

<p><b>Problem 3</b>: Let's build a simple "trend detector" to find out
when there are lots of arrivals at either Goldman Sachs or Citigroup
headquarters, defined in terms of the bounding boxes, exactly as
above. We'll consider intervals of ten minutes, i.e., 6:00 to 6:10,
6:10 to 6:20, etc. The trend detector should "go off" when there are
at least twice as many arrivals in the current interval as there are
in the past interval. To reduce "spurious" detections, we want to make
sure the detector only "trips" if there are <i>ten or more</i>
arrivals in the current interval. That is, if there are two arrivals
in the last ten minute interval and four arrivals in the current ten
minute interval, that's not particularly interesting (although the
number of arrival has indeed doubled), so we want to suppress such
results.</p>

<p>Call this program <code>TrendingArrivals</code>. We'll run it as
follows:</p>

<pre>
spark-submit --class ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a7.TrendingArrivals \
 target/assignments-1.0.jar --input taxi-data --checkpoint checkpoint --output output &> output.log
</pre>

<p>For simplicity, the detector should output its results
to <code>stdout</code> in the form of the following:</p>

<pre>
Number of arrivals to Goldman Sachs has doubled from X to Y at Z!
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
Number of arrivals to Citigroup has doubled from X to Y at Z!
</pre>

<p>Where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are the number of arrivals
in the previous and current interval, and <code>Z</code> is the
timestamp of the current interval. These timestamps are exactly the
same form as above, e.g., <code>21600000</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, when we're marking, we'll be
grepping <code>output.log</code> for the phrase "Number of arrivals to
Goldman Sachs" and "Number of arrivals to Citigroup", so please make
sure that the output is in the format we expect.</p>

<p>Also, the program should output the status for each batch to the directory specified by the <code>output</code> argument. Each status is stored in a separate file with the name of the format <code>part-${timestamp}</code> where timestamp is a 8-digit string padded with leading zeros. 

The following command should gather the answers:
<pre>
$ cat output/part-*/* | grep "(citigroup" 
(citigroup,(${Current value},${Current timestamp},${Previous value}))
...

$ cat output/part-*/* | grep "(goldman" 
(goldman,(${Current value},${Current timestamp},${Previous value}))
...
</pre>

<p>As a hint, <code>TrendingArrivals</code> is a simple modification
to <code>RegionEventCount</code>. You'll need to change the window
definition (from hourly to 10 minutes) and learn how to
use <code>mapWithState</code>, but that's basically it.</p>
