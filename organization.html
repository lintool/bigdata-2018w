<h3>Staff</h3>

<p>Students taking this course are formally enrolled in one of four
course numbers:</p>

<ul>

  <li>CS 451: this is the version for computer science undergraduates.
  Most students will be enrolled in this version.</li>

  <li>CS 651: this is the version for computer science graduate
  students. Students enrolled in this version complete all CS 451
  assignments plus an additional final project.</li>

  <li>CS 431: this is the version for undergraduates who
  are <i>not</i> majoring in computer science.</li>

  <li>CS 631: this is the version for graduate students <i>not</i> in
  computer science.</li>

</ul>

<p>All students meet in the same class session, but have different
assignments &mdash; so make sure you're doing the right
assignments!</p>

<p>Here's who's involved in the course:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/">Jimmy Lin</a> will
  deliver the lectures and is responsible for 451/651 assignments.</li>

  <li><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~kmsalem/">Ken Salem</a> is
  responsible for 431/631 assignments.</li>

  <li>The TAs are Youngbin Kim, Royal Sequiera, Zhucheng (Michael)
  Tu.</li>

</ul>

<p>For all course numbers: If you have general questions, post on
<a href="https://piazza.com/class/jbm9yylm7gd6j8">Piazza</a>. If you
have personal concerns, send email to
uwaterloo-bigdata-2018w-staff@googlegroups.com, which will reach the
instructors and the TAs. General questions sent to the mailing list
will be redirected to Piazza. Unless you specifically have a reason to
email the instructors directly, you're better off emailing the staff
list since the TAs may be able to help you directly (and in fact, for
routine issues the instructors will forward your email to the staff
list anyway).</p>

<h3>Course Materials</h3>

<p>The most recent version of all materials for this course will be
posted on this website, including the syllabus, readings, slides, and
assignments. Please check the site frequently for updates.</p>

<p>See the <a href="software.html">"software" page</a> for
instructions on getting access to MapReduce and Spark. Throughout this
course, you'll also be using <a href="http://bespin.io">Bespin</a>,
which is a software library that contains reference implementations of
"big data" algorithms in MapReduce and Spark.</p>

<p>The textbooks for this course are:</p>

<ul>

 <li><a href="http://mapreduce.cc/">Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce</a> by Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer</li>
 <li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033448.do">Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</a> (4th Edition) by Tom White [<a href="http://hadoopbook.com/">Book website</a>]</li>
 <li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028512.do">Learning Spark</a> by Holden Karau, Andy Konwinski, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia</lli>

</ul>

<img height="200" src="images/MR-cover.jpg"/>
<img height="200" src="images/Hadoop-cover.jpg"/>
<img height="200" src="images/Spark-cover.jpg"/>
</p>

<p>Note that the two O'Reilly books are <i>optional but
recommended</i>. They are mostly there to help you with the mechanics
of MapReduce and Spark (API, command-line invocations, etc.). However,
the same material can be found in a multitude of freely-available
sources on the web (although not organized as well). Note that the
Spark book is a bit outdated since it covers Spark 1.3; we're using
Spark 2.1. Readings from other sources will be assigned as
appropriate.</p>

<h3>Grading for CS 451/651</h3>

<p>Components of the final grade for CS 451 are as follows:</p>

<div style="width: 30%">
<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr><td><b>Component</b></td><td style="text-align:right"><b>Weight</b></td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr><td>Assignment 0</td>         <td style="text-align:right">5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 1</td>         <td style="text-align:right">5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 2</td>         <td style="text-align:right">5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 3</td>         <td style="text-align:right">5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 4</td>         <td style="text-align:right">10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 5</td>         <td style="text-align:right">10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 6</td>         <td style="text-align:right">10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assignment 7</td>         <td style="text-align:right">5%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Exam</td>           <td style="text-align:right">45%</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Total</b></td>         <td style="text-align:right">100%</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p><b>The homework assignments are to be completed individually.</b>
See below section on Academic Integrity. Assignments are due before
the class indicated on the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> (i.e.,
1:00pm).</p>

<p><b>Late policy:</b> For assignments up to 24 hours late, we will
take the grade you would have gotten and multiply it by 0.75 (i.e.,
25% reduction). For assignments more than 24 hours late but less than
48 hours late, we will take the grade you have gotten and multiply it
by 0.5 (i.e., 50% reduction). Assignments more than 48 hours late will
not be accepted. By assumption, we will mark your assignment at the
deadline &nbsp; if you want us to "hold off" on marking (and take the
late penalty), you <b>must</b> let us know, and you <b>must</b> let us
know when the assignment is ready for marking so we can compute the
late penalty appropriately. Email the staff mailing list for these
communications.</p>

<p><b>Assignment marking reappraisal requests:</b> If you believe we
have made an error marking your assignment, you may request that your
assignment be reappraised. Please email staff with the request
detailing the issue. Note that for each request, the <i>entire</i>
assignment will be reconsidered, in addition to the highlighted
issues. This means that your grade might be adjusted up or
down&mdash;the latter case if we found an error that was missed the
first time.</p>

<p>Components of the final grade for CS 651 are as follows:</p>

<div style="width: 30%">
<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr><td><b>Component</b></td><td style="text-align:right"><b>Weight</b></td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr><td>Assignments</td>          <td style="text-align:right">60%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Exam</td>           <td style="text-align:right">20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final Project</td>        <td style="text-align:right">20%</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Total</b></td>         <td style="text-align:right">100%</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>The relative weight of each assignment is the same as it is in the
CS 451 breakdown. CS 651 includes an additional <i>group</i> final
project.</p>

<h3>Grading for CS 431/631</h3>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>All work in this course is to be done individually unless otherwise
noted (e.g., the group final project for CS 651).</p>

<p>The penalty for plagiarism (first offense) is an assigned grade of
0 for that particular component <i>and</i> a 10% reduction of the
final grade. Note that this penalty applies to both the individual(s)
giving as well as the individual(s) receiving the assistance. In
addition, a letter detailing the offense will be sent to the Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, meaning that subsequent offenses will
carry more severe penalties, up to suspension or expulsion.</p>

<p>To avoid inadvertently plagiarizing, you should discuss assignment
issues with other students only in a very broad and high-level
fashion. Do not take notes during such discussions and do not looking
at anyone else's code, on screen or on paper. If you find yourself
stuck, contact the TAs or the instructor for help. You are allowed to
search the web for information about <i>general issues</i>, but do not
try to search for solutions online (or ask for help online on mailing
lists or in forums such as StackOverflow, etc.). The assignments are
designed so that solutions are not available online, but if you
inadvertently stumble onto a solution to any of the assignments, do
not look at it. If you do find a solution online, however, please let
us know&mdash;we will appreciate it and not construe it as plagiarism
(unless, of course, you actually do copy the solution).</p>

<p>Senate Undergraduate Council has asked us to post the following
paragraphs:</p>

<p><b>Academic Integrity:</b> In order to maintain a culture of
academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community
are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and
responsibility.</p>

<p><b>Grievance:</b> A student who believes that a decision affecting
some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable
may have grounds for initiating a
grievance. Read <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm">Policy
70 - Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>.

<p><b>Discipline:</b> A student is expected to know what constitutes
academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take
responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an
action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to
avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group
work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor,
academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. When misconduct
has been found to have occurred, disciplinary penalties will be
imposed
under <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm">Policy
71 - Student Discipline</a>. For information on categories of offenses
and types of penalties, students should refer to that policy.

<p><b>Avoiding Academic Offenses:</b> Most students are unaware of the
line between acceptable and unacceptable academic behaviour,
especially when discussing assignments with classmates and using the
work of other students.  For information on commonly misunderstood
academic offenses and how to avoid them, students should refer to the
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/regulations-and-procedures/cheating-and-student-academic-discipline-guidelines">Faculty
of Mathematics cheating and student academic discipline guidelines</a>.

<p><b>Appeals:</b> A student may appeal the finding and/or penalty in
a decision made under Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances
(other than regarding a petition) or Policy 71 - Student Discipline if
a ground for an appeal can be
established. Read <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm">Policy
72 - Student Appeals</a>.

<h3>Accommodations</h3>

<p><b>Illness policy:</b> From time to time students become ill or
have ongoing medical conditions that prevent them from meeting
academic obligations. For these cases, please consult
the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/final-examinations/academic-regulations-related-assignments-tests-and-final-1">university
policy</a>.</p>

<p><b>Accommodations for Religious Holidays and Other Special
Circumstances.</b> Students wishing to discuss accommodations for
religious holidays on dates that assignments are due, or other
circumstances not addressed in this course information page, should
discuss those circumstances with me before the third class session in
order to permit adequate time for planning. Only accommodations for
unforeseeable circumstances will be considered after that date.</p>

<p><b>Note for students with
disabilities:</b> <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services">AccessAbility
Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, collaborates with all academic
departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with
disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the
curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the
impact of your disability, please register with them at the beginning
of each academic term.</p>
