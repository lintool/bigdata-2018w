<h3>Assignment 0: Warmup <small>due 2:30pm January 16</small></h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to serve as a warmup exercise and
a practice "dry run" for the submission procedures of subsequent
assignments. You'll have to write a bit of code but this assignment is
mostly about the "mechanics" of setting up your Hadoop development
environment. In addition to running Hadoop locally in either the Linux
student CS environment or on your own machine, you'll also try running
jobs on the Altiscale cluster.</p>

<p>The general setup is as follows: you will complete your assignments
and check everything into a private GitHub repo. Shortly after the
assignment deadline, we'll pull your repo for marking.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you already have
a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. If not, create one
as soon as possible. Once you've signed up for an account, go and
<a href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new">request
an educational account</a>. This will allow you to create private
repos for free. Please do this as soon as possible since there may be
delays in the request verification process.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Setting up Hadoop and Spark</h4>

<p>Hadoop and Spark are already installed in
the <code>linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</code> environment (you just
need to do some simple config). Alternatively, you may wish to install
everything locally on your own machine. For both, see
the <a href="software.html">software page</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Bespin is a library that contains reference implementations of "big
data" algorithms in MapReduce and Spark. We'll be using it throughout
this course. Go and run
the <a href="https://github.com/lintool/bespin">Word Count in
MapReduce and Spark</a> example as shown in the Bespin README (clone
and build the repo, download the data files, run word count in both
MapReduce in Spark, and verify output). Assuming you are
using <code>linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca</code> (or if you have
properly set up your local environment), this task should be as simple
as copying and pasting commands from the Bespin README.</p>

<h4 style="padding-top: 10px">Time to write some code!</h4>

<p>Create a <b>private</b> repo
called <code>bigdata2018w</code>. I'm assuming that you're
already familiar with Git and GitHub, but just in case, here
is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">how you
create a repo on GitHub</a>. For "Who has access to this repository?",
make sure you click "Only the people I specify". If you've
successfully gotten an educational account (per above), you should be
able to create private repos for free. If you're not already familiar
with Git, there are plenty of good tutorials online: do a simple web
search and find one you like.</p>

<p>What you're going to do now is to copy the MapReduce word count
example into you own private repo. Start with
<a href="assignments/pom.xml">this <code>pom.xml</code></a>: copy it
into your <code>bigdata2018w</code> repo.</p>

<p>Next, copy:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>bespin/src/main/java/io/bespin/java/mapreduce/wordcount/WordCount.java</code> over to
  <li><code>bigdata2018w/src/main/java/ca/uwaterloo/cs451/a0/WordCount.java</code>.
</ul>

<p>Tip: <code>mkdir -p</code> creates parent directories as needed.
Open up this new version of <code>WordCount.java</code> using a
text editor (or your IDE of choice) and change the Java package
to <code>ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a0</code>.</p>

<p>Now, in the <code>bigdata2018w/</code> base directory, you should
be able to run Maven to build your package:</p>

<pre>
$ mvn clean package
</pre>

<p>Once the build succeeds, you should be able to run the word count
demo program in your own repository:</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/assignments-1.0.jar \
   ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a0.WordCount -input data/Shakespeare.txt -output wc
</pre>

<p>You should be running this in the Linux student CS environment or
on your own machine. Note that you'll need to copy over the
Shakespeare collection in <code>data/</code>. The output should be
exactly the same as the same program in Bespin, but the difference
here is that the code is now in a repository under your control.<p>

<p>Let's make a simple modification to word count: I would like to
know the distribution (counts) of all words that follow the word
"perfect". That is, for the phrase "perfect <i>x</i>", I want to know
how many times each word appears as the <i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> is
any non-zero-length word. To reduce noise, I am not interested
in <i>x</i>'s that appear only once.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> To be clear, use the "words" as generated by the
class <code>io.bespin.java.util.Tokenizer</code> class in Bespin. This
will ensure consistent handling of corner cases involving empty
strings, words containing punctuation, etc.</p>

<p>Create a program called <code>PerfectX</code> in the
package <code>ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a0</code> that implements the
specifications above.</p>

<pre>
$ hadoop jar target/assignments-1.0.jar ca.uwaterloo.cs451.a0.PerfectX \
   -input data/Shakespeare.txt -output cs451-lintool-a0-shakespeare
</pre>

<p>You shouldn't need to write more than a couple lines of code
(beyond changing class names and other boilerplate). We'll go over the
Hadoop API in more detail in class, but the changes should be
straightforward.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> In the Shakespeare collection, what is the most
frequent <i>x</i> and how many times does it appear? (Answer this
question with command-line tools.)</p>

<p>You can run the above instructions using
<a href="assignments/check_assignment0_public_linux.py"><code>check_assignment0_public_linux.py</code></a> as follows:</p>

<pre>
$ wget http://lintool.github.io/bigdata-2018w/assignments/check_assignment0_public_linux.py
$ chmod +x check_assignment0_public_linux.py
$ ./check_assignment0_public_linux.py lintool
</pre>

<p>We'll be using exactly this script to check your assignment in the
Linux Student CS environment. <b>Important:</b> Make sure that your
code runs there even if you do development on your own machine.</p>
